# Pyramid-Generator
---
## What it does
This little program allows you to generates a pyramid made out of *'s with your desired height.

## How it works
The layer of the pyramid gets bigger the lower it is, thus makes the top (first) layer a single *. To increase the area of the next layer, the next layer should first have the same size of its previous layer, then add one * on both its left and right side. 

## Why I made this program
I made a similar program during my first year of programming in high school, it was made in C++. Personally I think this is a good program to start when learning a new language, so that's why I revisit this program again in JavaScript.

## The future
In the future I plan to improve the visual of the program using CSS and images. Things like different pattern for the pyramid blocks, background image, better text etc.
